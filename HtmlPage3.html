    <h1> introduction to javascribt </h1>
    <p>JavaScript ,[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
     specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
     curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript
     enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
     websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
     engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
     It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
     standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not
     include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host
     environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
     usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such
     as Electron and Cordova.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax,
     and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
    <h2>Growth and standardization</h2>
    <p>During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was 
    stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox
     browser. Firefox was well-received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[19]

In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard.
     This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were
     implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft.
     The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems 
    released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript
     3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft,
     ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.

Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open source communities not affiliated with 
    ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax
     and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications
     where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked 
    a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that
     formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, 
    and MooTools.

Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was the first to use 
    just-in-time compilation, significantly improving execution times.[20][21] Other browser vendors 
    needed to overhaul their engines to compete.[22]

In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual 
    agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was 
    the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.</p>
