    <h1>introduction about java</h1>
    <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to
     have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write
     once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
     Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that 
    can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
     As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20]
     particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle)
     and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference 
    implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released 
    by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of 
    the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General
     Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies,
     such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries),
     and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>
    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
            <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
            <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
            <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
            <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
