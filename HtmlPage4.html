    <h1>C Sharp (programming language)</h1>
    <p>C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign)[b] is
     a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped,
     imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented 
    programming disciplines.[17] It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative 
    and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270)
     in 2003. Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for
     the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure 
    (CLI).

   C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. 
    The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual 
    Studio 2019 version 16.3.[18]</p>
    <h2>Portability</h2>
    <p>By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language
     Infrastructure (CLI).[57] Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the 
    CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of
     the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime,
     or generate Common Intermediate Language (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Theoretically, 
    a C# compiler could generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or Fortran.</p>
