    <h1>C++</h1>
    <p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of 
    the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time,
     and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities 
    for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many 
    vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle,
     and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large 
    systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also 
    been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and 
    resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games,
     servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications 
    (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
     standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 
    (informally known as C++17).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998
     as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards.
     The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.
     Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer
     scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language;
     he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level
     features for program organization.[13] C++20 is the next planned standard, keeping with the
     current trend of a new version every three years.[14]</p>
